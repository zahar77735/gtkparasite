Parasite has moved to GTK
=========================

[Parasite](https://chipx86.github.io/gtkparasite/) was a fun project that
provided some useful live-debugging tools for GTK-based applications. It
was such a success that now it's part of GTK itself.

[GtkInspector](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GTK/Inspector)
is the successor to Parasite. It's actively maintained and far more useful.
Parasite itself has been shut down.

Want to see what the developers of Parasite are now up to? Well, we started a
company called [Beanbag](https://www.beanbaginc.com/), where we build *other*
awesome development tools.

Our main product is [Review Board](https://www.reviewboard.org/), a widely-used
tool for code and document review. This takes up most of our time.

The little Parasite guy lives on as the Splat bug, heading up our bug tracker,
[Splat](https://hellosplat.com/tour/).
